# Logistic-Regression-with-TensorFlow
This repo helps to know more about Logistic Regression and it executes with the help of TensorFlow Library <br><br><br>
<b>Tensorflow</b> is a large Open-source Software library by Google.
<br>It is used for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
<br>It helps in Faster Compilation and used in many ML and Deep neural network applications.
<br><br><br>
<b>Logistic regression</b> is one of the Supervised Learning Algorithm where it allows categorizing data into discrete classes by learning the relationship from a given set of labeled data.<br> It learns a linear relationship from the given dataset and then introduces a non-linearity in the form of the Sigmoid function. 
<br><br>
Now, We understand this logistic regression using "Iris Dataset"
<br> <b>Source</b> : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
<br><br>
This dataset was introduced by British Statistician and Biologist Ronald Fisher, it consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). In total it has 150 records under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species.

    <h2>Logistic Regression Model</h2>
    <p>Logistic regression is typically thought of as a single equation:</p>
    <p><strong>Å· = sigmoid(WX + b)</strong></p>
    <p>However, for the sake of clarity, we can have it broken into its three main components:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A weight times features matrix multiplication operation
            <p><strong>WX</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>A summation of the weighted features and a bias term
            <p><strong>WX + b</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, the application of a sigmoid function
            <p><strong>sigmoid(WX + b)</strong></p>
        </li>
    </ol>

Now, Let's decode-
<h4>What happened there!!</h4>
<body>
    <ol>
        <li>Started by installing Tensorflow and required packages.</li>
        <li>Imported the needed libraries such as Numpy,Pandas,time,tensorflow,sci-kit learn and matplot library.</li>
        <li>Loaded the Iris dataset from the source. </li>
        <li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
        <li>Extracted the features and labels from the iris dataset</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The features are the input we want to use to make a prediction, the label is the data we want to predict.</li></ul>
        <li>Randomly sample the data from a normal distribution with standard deviation .01 .</li>
        <li>Defined the logistic regression function with a sigmoid activation and mean squared logarithmic error loss function</li>
        <li>Trained the model using the training data for 700 epochs.</li> 
        <li>Here, we used the SGD optimizer.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For those who are thinking about what is SGD is, Stochastic Gradient Descent(often abbreviated SGD) is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties (e.g. differentiable or subdifferentiable).</li></ul>
        <li>Later,the metrics argument specifies that we want to track accuracy during training and evaluation.</li>
        <li>At last, we evaluated the model on the iris dataset and get the accuracy metrics.</li>
        <li>For our comfort, we printed the accuracy predicted values in the form a graphical plot which resembles a sigmoid function as shown above.</li>
    </ol>

That's it!!
<br>This is how logistic regression can be used for binary classification with TensorFlow.<br>I know that everyone knows this...still learning never goes waste.<br>Thanks for being with me till the end!!<br> Will meet you soon
            <br>P.S.: I am open to know my mistakes to grow better, Please do tell your opinion and give your feedback @yuvasree.t9@gmail.com . Thanks in advance<br>To the dreams!!<br>Cheers!!!
