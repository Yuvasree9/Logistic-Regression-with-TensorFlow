# Logistic-Regression-with-TensorFlow
This repo helps to know more about Logistic Regression and it executes with the help of TensorFlow Library <br><br><br>
Tensorflow is a large Open-source Software library by Google.
<br>It is used for numerical computation using data flow graphs.
<br>It helps in Faster Compilation and used in many ML and Deep neural network applications.

Logistic regression is one of the Supervised Learning Algorithm where it allows categorizing data into discrete classes by learning the relationship from a given set of labeled data.<br> It learns a linear relationship from the given dataset and then introduces a non-linearity in the form of the Sigmoid function.
